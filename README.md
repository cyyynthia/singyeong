# 신경

Singyeong (신경) is the nerve-center of your microservices-based application. 

I have it on good authority (read: Google Translate) that 신경 means "nerve." I
considered naming this something like 등뼈 (deungppyeo, "spine"/"backbone") or 
회로망 (hoelomang, "network") or even 별자리 (byeoljali, "constellation), but I 
figured that 신경 would be easier for people who don't know Korean to pronounce.
